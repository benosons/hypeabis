              <h4 class="fw-500"><b>3. Contributor Obligations.</b></h4><hr/>

              3.1. Intellectual Property Matters<br/>

                (a) Third Party Claims. If USER has knowledge that a party claims an
                intellectual property right in particular functionality or code (or
                its utilization under this License), USER must include a text file
                with the source code provided to BINARY titled "LEGAL" which
                describes the claim and the party making the claim in sufficient
                detail that BINARY will know whom to contact. If USER obtains
                such knowledge after USER makes the Modification available to
                BINARY, USER shall promptly modify the LEGAL file in all copies
                USER makes available thereafter and shall notify BINARY that new
                knowledge has been obtained.<br/>

                (b) Contributor APIs. If Your Modification is an application
                programming interface and USER owns or controls patents, which are
                reasonably necessary to implement that API, you must also include
                this information in the LEGAL file.<br/><br/>

              3.2. Required Notices. USER must duplicate the notice in Exhibit A in
                each file of the Source Code, and this License in any documentation
                for the Source Code, where USER describes recipients' rights
                relating to Covered Code. If USER created one or more
                Modification(s), USER may add name as a Contributor to the notice
                described in Exhibit A. If it is not possible to put such notice in
                a particular Source Code file due to its structure, then USER must
                include such notice in a location (such as a relevant directory
                file) where a user would be likely to look for such a notice.<br/><br/>
              
              3.3. Larger Works. USER may create a Larger Work by combining Covered
                Code with other code not governed by the terms of this License. In
                such a case, USER must make sure the requirements of this License
                are fulfilled for the Covered Code including 2.1d and 2.1e.<br/><br/>

              <h4 class="fw-500"><b>4. Inability to Comply Due to Statute or Regulation.</b></h4><hr/>

                If it is impossible for USER to comply with any of the terms of this
                License with respect to some or all of the Covered Code due to
                statute or regulation then USER must:<br/>

                (a) comply with the terms of this License to the maximum extent
                possible; and<br/>

                (b) describe the limitations and the code they affect. Such
                description must be included in the LEGAL file described in Section
                3.1 and must be included with all distributions of the Source
                Code. Except to the extent prohibited by statute or regulation, such
                description must be sufficiently detailed for a recipient of
                ordinary skill to be able to understand it.<br/><br/>

                LOSSES, EVEN IF SUCH PARTY SHALL HAVE BEEN INFORMED OF THE

                AND LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO USER.<br/><br/>

                conferring by implication, estoppel or otherwise any license or
